                    Unfortunately, if you are failing to authenticate to the Calamari servers, your ISP (internet service provider) or internet configuration could be blocking our host. We cannot help you with this, however, you may be able to fix it by making sure that your date and time settings are correct, and by testing to see if it works on a VPN. Other than that, try restoring your computer to its factory settings.

                    <div style="width:600px;display:inline-block;">
                     As stated in the TOS, upon request, we have the right to enroll you in courses for Calamari training at any point at any time without reason. Unfortunately, we cannot disclose what the grammatical test is being used for.

                    <div style="width:600px;display:inline-block;">
                     Yes. Upon sign-in, Calamari will attach to your network and automatically release itself after five minutes of activity. If you are using Calamari on the same network, you may have as many computers as you want using the Calamari software at once. If another computer from another network attempts to login using the credentials, it will display a notice that the account is already in use.

                    <div style="width:600px;display:inline-block;">
                      There are actually two auto execute folders listed under C:/Calamari/auto_execute. The first one, auto_attach, will run all of the scripts in the folder the moment Calamari detects that a process is found. The second folder, on_run_button, will run all the scripts inside the folder the first time you press the "run" button to inject a script on that process.

                    <div style="width:600px;display:inline-block;">
                    To use this, make sure Calamari is not attached to any process, and those processes are closed. Then, check to Tools->Multi Applications->Enable Multi Applications. Afterwards, you can open as many Windows as you want. Whenever you want to inject scripts into one of these application, you can choose a PID from the Tools->Multi Applications menu, and a new Calamari window will pop up attached onto that process.
